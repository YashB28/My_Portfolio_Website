| storage.ts | Data storage interface (in-memory) |

## HOW IT WORKS

### Frontend Flow
1. User visits website → React app loads
2. Components render with your personal data
3. Animations trigger on scroll using Framer Motion
4. Form validation happens in real-time with React Hook Form
5. API calls made through React Query

### Backend Flow
1. Express server starts on port 5000
2. API routes handle contact form submissions
3. Data validated with Zod schemas
4. Email sent via SendGrid API
5. Response sent back to frontend

### Contact Form Process
1. **User fills form** → Client-side validation with Zod
2. **Data sent to /api/contact** → Server-side validation
3. **Message saved to storage** → Email sent via SendGrid
4. **Success response** → User sees confirmation toast

## API ENDPOINTS

### POST /api/contact
- **Purpose:** Handle contact form submissions
- **Method:** POST
- **Content-Type:** application/json

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "email": "string", 
  "subject": "string",
  "message": "string"
}
```

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Message sent successfully!"
}
```

**Response (Error):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description",
  "errors": ["validation errors"]
}
```

- **Validation:** Zod schema validation on both client and server
- **Features:** Email delivery, data storage, error handling

    email: "",
    subject: "",
    message: "",
  },
});

#### 2. API Route Structure
```typescript
app.post("/api/contact", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const validatedData = insertContactMessageSchema.parse(req.body);
    const message = await storage.createContactMessage(validatedData);
    const emailSent = await sendContactEmail(validatedData);
    res.json({ success: true, message: "Message sent successfully!" });
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
  }
});
```

#### 3. Email Template Generation
```typescript
await mailService.send({
  to: 'ybhushan2002@gmail.com',
  from: 'ybhushan2002@gmail.com',
  replyTo: params.email,
  subject: `Portfolio Contact: ${params.subject}`,
  html: emailTemplate,
});
```
